# Run Instructions 
- Download XCode 15.
- Decompress the project file, then double click the .xcodeproj file. This should open the project in XCode.
- Hit the play button (large triangle) at the top of the Xcode window or cmd-R. This will launch an iPhone Simulator instance with the app on it. 
- Wait for the simulator to load and launch the app. You should see a “Library” home screen upon load completion.
- AudioRecording may not work with the simulator. Pressing the record button might show an error due to the lack of recording permission.
- To interact with recording as intended, you will need to connect an iPhone. In XCode, in the top bar on the left hand side, select MemoNest > [Destination] and change to your device. Then hit play or cmd-R, which will install and launch the app on your device.
